# MERN-Stack-MyTube

In the poject I have try to clone UI and some functionality similar to YouTube.
We can watch videos and add comment. To add comment we have to first logIn so I have implemented jwt authentication.
The user can edit his/her comment below the video.
The possword of the users are encrypted.
For Testing I have made 3 users, where 2 are content creators and 1 is normal user
Any user can creat his/her own channel by giving channel name.
User 1 (Content Creater)
    email id : abc@gamil.com
    password : abc
User 2 (Content Creator)
    email id : efg@gamil.com
    password : efg
User 3 (normal user)
    email id : xyz@gmail.com
    password : xyz
